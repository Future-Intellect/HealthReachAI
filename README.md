*AI Solution for communities focusing on improving healthcare in underprivileged communities*

Our proposed AI Solution is aligned with the theme "an AI Solution for communities"by focusing on improving healthcare access underprivileged communities. The problem we aim to address is the lack of timely and efficient healthcare services in these areas, leading to preventable illness and suffering. Through implementation of AI-powered telemedicine platforms, we tend to connect with local residents with medical proffesionals remotely, enabling them medical advice, prescription and consultations without the need to travel long distances or wait for extrended periods.


The problem stems from limited healthcare infrastructure, inadequate resources, and a shortage of medical personnels in these communities. By utilizing AI, we can leverage natural language processing for symptoms assessment, image recognition for diagnosing certain conditions, predective analytics for identifying potential outbreaks or health trends. This AI Solution not only reduces the burden on local healthcare facilities but also empowers individuals to take control of their health.

*Model:*

Cross-Validation: We will use cross-validation approaches to avoid overfitting and evaluate the model's capacity for generalization. The dataset will be divided into subsets for testing, validation, and training. This enables us to check the model's robustness and accuracy on unobserved data.
Metrics Selection: 
We will choose pertinent metrics that are specific to each element of our solution. Metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy will be used to evaluate the chatbot's Natural Language Processing (NLP)-powered ability to comprehend and reply to user inquiries. While treatment recommendation algorithms will be evaluated using accuracy and mean squared error, disease outbreak prediction models will be assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC).
Collaboration with Medical Experts: 
Medical experts will be crucial in determining how accurate our AI model is. We will evaluate the model's diagnostic efficacy in collaboration with healthcare professionals by contrasting its predictions with professional opinions. Our AI model is validated to make sure it adheres to medical norms.

Real-world Testing:
We will conduct real-world testing by deploying the AI model in controlled environments within target communities. This will allow us to assess its performance in actual scenarios and gather insights on its accuracy in providing healthcare guidance.
User Satisfaction Surveys:
 We will conduct surveys and gather feedback from local residents who have interacted with the AI-powered telemedicine platform in order to assess the model's effectiveness from the perspective of users. This input will shed light on the model's precision and effect on access to healthcare.

Time Series Analysis on Data:
We used the time series data for analysis. Since time series allows us to use past data within a given duration of time to predict the spread of infectious diseases. In terms of our Telemedicine platform, we used Pandas package to help us create range of resemble data of infectious diseases and chronic condition. Pandas helps in Standardising data formats and units to ensure consistency. After using the time series analysis, it showed us the trend of infectious diseases will decrease by 40.5% as   individuals will be able to take control of their health. Seasonality infectious disease rate varies in terms of season as after performing the analysis it shows during cold season rate Influenza is mostly to increase and Dengue Fever during the rainy season gradually increases. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the cyclic infectious diseases that is not seasonal. We also used matplotlib to visualize trends and patterns of the infectious disease data. We also used the plotly for healthcare facilities who will access the information through website to get accurate analysis on health of people in the community.
